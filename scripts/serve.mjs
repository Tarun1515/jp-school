/*==============================================================================
  `npm start` — ng serve with a NON-NEGOTIABLE port (4300).

  Pinning `port` in angular.json is necessary but NOT sufficient. When the port
  is busy, @angular/build's checkPort does this:

      not a TTY  -> reject: "Port 4300 is already in use."
      a TTY      -> prompt: "Would you like to use a different port?"
                    ...with `default: true`, and on yes it calls checkPort(0),
                    which asks the OS for ANY free port.

  So in a real terminal, a stale server plus one press of Enter silently serves
  this app on an ephemeral port. That is not cosmetic: decision 2.17 pins these
  ports, and both APIs' CORS allow-lists and every environment.ts are wired to
  them. On any other port the app loads and then every API call fails — a far
  more confusing failure than a refusal to start.

  With four apps a stale dev server is the normal case, not the unlucky one.

  NG_FORCE_TTY=0 makes isTTY() return false, so the prompt never appears and a
  busy port is a hard error with a clear message.
