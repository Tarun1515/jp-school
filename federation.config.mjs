/*==============================================================================
  jp-school — a HOST. Loads everything shared from the jp-shared remote (:4999).

  🔴 `externals` is what makes a plain `import { UiButtonComponent } from
  'jp-shared/ui'` work.

  Native Federation has no "static remotes" mode: its documented API is the
  async loadRemoteModule(), which cannot feed a component's `imports: []` —
  Angular needs the class at component-definition time, not a promise. Listing
  the four specifiers here instead leaves them UNRESOLVED in the build output,
  and initFederation installs an import map whose keys are built as
  join(remoteName, exposeKey) — literally `jp-shared/ui`. The browser then
  resolves the bare specifier to the remote's bundle.

  So: TypeScript resolves these for types only (tsconfig paths); the browser
  resolves them for real, at runtime, from :4999.

  ⚠️ These four strings must match jp-shared's `name` + `exposes` keys exactly.
